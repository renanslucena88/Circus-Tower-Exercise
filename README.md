# CIRCUS TOWER EXERCISE

A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one anotherâ€™s shoulders. For
practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below
him or her.

Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest
possible number of people in such a tower.

Keep in mind that you are computing the tallest tower possible, which may or may not include every
person provided in the input.

**Input**

Input contains the height and weight of all the people, one per each line. (Height and weight are
separated by a comma.)

**Output**

Print N lines containing the height and weight of each person forming the tower from top of the tower
to the bottom. (Height and weight are separated by a comma.)
